# taskbar-monitor
DeskBand with monitoring charts (CPU and memory) for Windows

This app shows some cool graphs displaying CPU and memory usage on the taskbar (as a Desk Band).

Fork of https://github.com/leandrosa81/taskbar-monitor, ported to the .NET 6 runtime. Also includes the start of a WPF deskband (which I may or may not finish).
